## Architecture
The Calendar View component is built using React + TypeScript and structured into modular components:

CalendarView â€“ main container handling state, navigation, and view mode (month/week).

MonthView â€“ displays a 6x7 grid calendar for month view, uses CalendarCell for each day.

WeekView â€“ displays days as columns with hourly time slots, supports events per day.

CalendarCell â€“ represents each day in MonthView, shows events and allows quick-add.

EventModal â€“ modal for creating/editing events.
Hooks such as useCalendar and useEventManager manage state and event handling. Tailwind CSS handles styling and responsiveness.
